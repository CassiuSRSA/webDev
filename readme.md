# My Web Development Repository

## About me

I am an aspiring web developer with a strong interest in data. I have always loved working with technology, from building my 1st PC when I was around 8 years old to making interesting web apps to make daily life easy.

## Whats in the box?

This repository contains all my web development projects on my portfolio website as well other projects I am proud of showing off.
